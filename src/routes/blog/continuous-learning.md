If you're not continuously learning, you're falling behind. It's that simple. The world is changing faster than ever before, and those who don't keep up will get left behind. The good news is that continuous learning is within everyone's reach – it doesn't require a formal education or a lot of money. All it takes is a willingness to learn and an open mind. In this post, I'm going to share three tactics that I use to hold myself accountable to continuous learning. Hopefully, they will assist you in achieving the same thing!

## 1. Set aside time each day to grow. Read, listen or practice something new.

Ensure that you're making continuous learning a priority by setting time aside for it every day. Dedicate 30-60 minutes each morning to reading, practicing new skills, or working on other personal development tasks. This will help you get into the habit of regularly investing in yourself and make it less likely that you will forget or put off learning altogether.

I personally to listen to a side hustle podcast in the morning. It's an excellent way for me to learn about what others have done to get ideas and motivation.

If you don't have time for a full hour each day, try breaking up your development time into smaller chunks. Dedicate 15 minutes in the morning and evening to reading or spend 30 minutes one day per week working on a new skill. Make sure you do something every day to get closer to your objectives.

**Protip**: If you find it difficult to dedicate time specifically for personal development, try integrating it into other activities you already do each day. For example, listen to an audio book while you're driving or working out, or read articles on your lunch break.

## 2. Talk to specialists, and when working in large organizations, use your own networks.

Look for individuals who know a lot about the topics you want to learn more about and ask them questions. Not only will this help you gain insights that you wouldn't have otherwise, but it will also help expand your network of professionals.

As the competitive intelligence manager, I had to conduct cross-functional talks in order to really grasp where everyone was aligned, allowing me to craft content specifically for the right personas.

When working in a large organization, it can be difficult to know where to start when it comes to seeking out experts. In this case, leverage your own networks. Ask friends and colleagues for recommendations or connect with people on social media who are knowledgeable in the areas you want to learn more about.

**Protip**: Don't be afraid to ask for help! Most people are open to answering questions and would love to help a colleague learn more about their field.

## 3. Lean in on something uncomfortable. It's where growth occurs.

Challenging yourself to learn new things or do things in a different way can be scary, but it's also where the growth happens. When you push yourself outside of your comfort zone, you open yourself up to new opportunities and experiences.

I never really liked expressing my views because I was always afraid that I didn't have all the answers. As a result, I needed to gather all of the proof to support my assertions in order to gain more confidence from individuals.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes while you're learning. They are a natural part of the process and will help you improve in the long run. Continuous learning is essential for professional growth, so don't let anything stand in your way!

**Protip**: Start small. If you're not used to being uncomfortable, challenge yourself to do one new thing each week that makes you feel a little uneasy. Over time, this will add up and help you become more comfortable with embracing discomfort.

## In conclusion

To stay ahead of the competition and continue growing in your life, it’s essential that you make continuous learning a habit. It doesn't matter what industry you're in, there is always more to learn and explore. Set aside some time each day for self-development by talking with experts and reading books on topics outside your expertise. You'll be surprised at how quickly things will start coming together if you apply this simple strategy consistently!
