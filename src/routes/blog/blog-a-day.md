In today's competitive market, it takes something extra to stand out from the crowd. Some companies do this with flashy ads or clever marketing schemes. Others rely on their quality products or customer service. But one of the best ways to set yourself apart is by being a frequent blogger. A blog a day can show your clients that you're constantly working and keep you top-of-mind. Not sure where to start? This post will give you some ideas on how to create content that engages your audience and drives results.

## What are you passionate about and can write topics on without getting bored?

Do you find yourself browing interior design? Looking up recipes? There are blog posts for days (literally) on any topic that interests you. And if you're stuck for ideas, there are plenty of resources online to help get the creative juices flowing.

I get a lot of my inspiration from Discord servers, Facebook groups, or subreddits that I subscribe to. I'm a member of those groups because I enjoy reading what they have to offer, and I'm sure your audience will feel the same way about your blog.

Once you've found a topic you're interested in and are passionate about, it's time to start creating content. This doesn't mean you have to write a new blog post every day – there's other creative ways in keeping things interesting – you can also share articles, images, or videos that you think your audience will enjoy.

**Protip**: You're probably already doing this on Facebook and gaining a lot of likes. You're already making readers feel good from each post, that they're more than likely enjoy your next post. Simply convert that energy into a blog!

## Encourage your readers to share why they enjoy what you like. 

This is a great way to start building a community around your blog and create loyalty among your readers. Don't be afraid to experiment with different formats and styles, either. Some people prefer shorter posts while others enjoy longer-form content. Find what works best for you and stick to it, but always be willing to try something new.

I prefer to keep blog articles between 600 and 1,000 words because this is the norm for professional news, particularly newspapers. I believe it's fairly effective in terms of getting exposure. Long-form blogs are another style I didn't discuss in this post, but it'll have to wait for another day.

**Protip**: Your audience are your friends. It's critical to be genuine and engaging. They will quickly abandon participation if you aren't genuine. Be yourself and pursue your dreams with enthusiasm!

## It all comes back to where it started. Use social media to share your material.

After you've established a few pieces, start promoting them on social media. Make sure to utilize relevant hashtags and @mentioning people who might be interested in your content. You may also post short excerpts from your writing on Twitter or Facebook, asking readers to go to your blog for the full story. This is an excellent method to attract new fans and followers.

I previously didn't use Facebook as much because I had nothing to share, however now that I have my blog, which will grow with more information, it will be one of the first places I post to. I usually use Instagram for items without context since it's faster.

Remember, your blog is a reflection of you, so write about what you love and are interested in. Be sure to add personality and excitement to your writing, and you'll start seeing results in no time.
