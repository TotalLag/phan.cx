 * `{{svelteComponent name="Clock" options='{"preload":true}' props='{"foo": true}' /}}`

  /**
   *
   * A common issue with static content is that someone will need to go back and update that content.
   * * Imagine you have your content in a CMS such as WordPress, Contentful, Prismic, or even a markdown file.
   * * Within this content some "decision maker" has decided that you need to display the number of pages on your site... and it always has to be accurate.
   *
   * Usually pulling this off would require you to put a placeholder like {{numberOfPages /}} and then preprocessing the content, counting the number of pages, and then rendering it.
   *
   * With Elder.js shortcodes, all the preprocessing is done for you, you just need to decide what you want to replace it with.
   *
   * Below is code for the usecase above.
   *
   * It is important to note, even if you wanted {{latestInstagramPhoto /}} to be shown, the same approach would apply. Just use something like
   * `node-fetch` to hit Instagram's API and specify what html, css, js you'd like to add to the page.
